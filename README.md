# GlobalSynth
Copyright Â© 2017 Randy Rollofson

GlobalSynth is a synthesizer built with JavaScript and uses the Web Audio API. The synth runs completely inside the web browser (Chrome is recommended), no additional software is required. 

**Update:**
GlobalSynth is currently playable with computer keys "awsedftgyhujkolp;'" which correspond to pitchs C3-F4.
The synth is currently monophonic but I am currently working on making it polyphonic. I also plan on making the synth playable via MIDI keyboard controller. Future plans also include adding on to the keyboard gui, making it look more like an actual instrument by adding oscillator, filter, envelope, and gain controls.
